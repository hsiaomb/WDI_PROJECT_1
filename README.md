Beat Repeat
===========

A re-imagining of the classic game Simon Says/Bop-it. Two players in the game - One player sets the sequence, and the other repeats it! See if you got what it takes! Or Play against a Computer!

## Instructions

This game requires two players - I wasn't able to integrate AI for a single player mode before the due date of the project.

Players take turns joining two horizontally or vertically adjacent dots by a line. A player that completes the fourth side of a square (a box) fills it with their colour and gets to play again (see below).

When once player has more than half of the boxes coloured, that player wins and the game is over.

Enjoy!
